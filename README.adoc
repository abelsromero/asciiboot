= Asciidoctor + Spring Boot + K8s
:asciidoctor-docs-url: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/
:toc: preamble
:validation: You should be able to access the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready[Actuator] endpoint http://localhost:8080/actuator.

This project shows how work with a containerized https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] service to convert documents with {asciidoctor-docs-url}asciidoctorj/latest[Asciidoctorj].

== Requirements

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind]: to create a simplified local K8s cluster.
* https://skaffold.dev/[Skaffold]: to automate, build, deploy and debugging, with life-reload.
Debugging requires IntelliJ + https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8079-cloud-code[Cloud Code plugin].

== Features

=== Metrics

Skaffold deployment adds https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server[metrics server] adapted for Kind.
Once <<_skaffold,deployed>>, you can check the resources used by the pod with

 $ kubectl top pods

== Build & Deploy

Note deploying in just Docker or local K8s requires the minimal setup, but also require more manual steps.
And doesn't allow for life-reload and code debugging from IntelliJ.

=== Docker only

To run in plain Docker, build the image and run it.

 $ ./gradlew bootBuildImage
 $ docker run -it -p8080:8080 asciiboot:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

=== Kubernetes only

. Start a local Kind cluster

 $ kind create cluster

. Build Spring Boot docker image

 $ ./gradlew bootBuildImage

. Load image into Kind

 $ kind load docker-image asciiboot:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

. Deploy in Kind's K8s cluster

 $ kubectl apply -f asciiboot-pod.yaml

[TIP]
====
You can run all commands at once with:
----
$ ./gradlew clean bootBuildImage && \
kind load docker-image asciiboot0.0.1-SNAPSHOT && \
kubectl apply -f asciiboot-pod.yaml
----
====

To validate it:

 $ kubectl port-forward asciiboot 8080:8080

{validation}

=== Skaffold

Skaffold automates the complete process of building, deploying, port-forwarding and debugging.
It also offers life-reload, so that changes in the code ar automatically deployed in the local k8s cluster.

To just run without debugging

 $ skaffold dev

{validation}

For debugging install https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8079-cloud-code[Cloud Code plugin] in IntelliJ.
Create a `Cloud Code: Kubernetes` with the `Run > Edit Configurations` option, and run it as `Debug`.

You should see the app logs in the ID console and be able to add breakpoints and debug as any other Java app.
